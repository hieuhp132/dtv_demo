Hyli is built to unlock what proofs make possible: customizability, scalability, and privacy.\n\nHyli combines native proof verification embedded directly into the protocol with a fast data dissemination and data availability layer powered by the Autobahn consensus algorithm.\n\nComputation must be verifiable, so we enshrined proof verification into the protocol and made it effortless to compose different proofs.\n\nProofs introduce latency and overhead, so we invented pipelined proving to remove this bottleneck.\n\nThe future runs on appchains, so everything on Hyli is an appchain by default: apps sequence on Hyli and update their state with a corresponding proof.\n\nHyli is:\n\nHighly simple: no execution environment, no native runtime. Just proofs and data.\n\nHighly efficient: leveraging the latest in consensus design (Autobahn) and proof systems (Risc0, SP1, Noir, etc.).\n\nHighly usable: identity and access flows powered by existing user credentials (email, wallets, credentials) and signed data (passports).\n\nHighly orange.\n\nFueled by a $3.4M investment from top-tier venture capitalists, our team is led by our founders Sylve (CEO) and Lancelot (CTO).\n\nThe team\n\nWe are currently a team of 8, including five developers.\n\nYou will work alongside the business team: Sylve (CEO), Cécile (Chief of Staff), Alex S. (Head of Content) and Matteo (Discovery team).\n\nInterview Process\n1,Hiring Manager Interview\n2,Take Home Test\n3,Technical Interview\n4,Final Interview\n\nHiring Criteria\n\nMin 2 years experience in a similar role\n\nEarly stage start up experience\n\nExceptional short-form writing\n\nCrypto native with a deep understanding of Twitter culture and narratives\n\nAbout Hyli\nHylé is the core layer for the modular ZK stack: a decentralised, censorship-resistant settlement layer for all proofs.\nhttps://www.hyli.org/"

Its mission is to make financial infrastructure a public good by providing an open, efficient, and resilient platform for on-chain loans. Morpho enables anyone to earn yield or borrow crypto assets permissionlessly, while also allowing developers and businesses to build custom lending markets and vaults on its infrastructure.</p><p><br></p><p>Since launch, Morpho has grown into one of the largest DeFi lending systems (≈$6 B in deposits as of mid-2025) operating on Ethereum and other chains. Its vision is to become a cornerstone of a new internet-native financial system by fusing DeFi lending with traditional fintech.</p><p><br></p><p>Product Offerings</p><p>Morpho offers a suite of lending/borrowing products and developer tools built around its smart-contract protocol:</p><p><br></p><p>Consumer Products (Earn/Borrow):</p><p>Retail users can deposit assets into Morpho Vaults to earn optimized interest, or post collateral to borrow other tokens. Morpho optimizes yields by peer-to-peer matching within its vaults on top of base pools like Aave/Compound. Borrowers enjoy higher collateral limits and no protocol fees.</p><p><br></p><p>Curate/Vaults (Prime):</p><p>Power users and institutions can deploy custom vaults and lending markets. The Curate interface lets “vault curators” configure collateral types, interest models, and risk parameters, earning fees for supplying liquidity. These vaults are open, customizable, and scalable, benefiting from Morpho’s liquidity and matching engine. This is powered by the “Morpho Blue” protocol — a minimal core lending engine designed for security and flexibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Developer Tools (Infra):</p><p>Morpho provides on-chain and off-chain infrastructure for developers. A public GraphQL API and SDK libraries let applications query Morpho data and integrate lending functions. Enterprises can build their own lending use cases on Morpho’s stack, benefitting from audited, formally-verified contracts and DevOps tools.</p><p><br></p><p>Morpho infrastructure underpins notable integrations — for example, Coinbase’s on-chain lending launched in early 2025 uses Morpho on the Base chain to offer crypto-backed loans through the Coinbase app.</p><p><br></p><p>Funding History</p><p>Morpho Labs has raised approximately $70 M in venture funding (mostly through token sales):</p><p>Seed Round (Oct 2021): ~$1.35 M, led by Semantic Ventures and Nascent</p><p>Strategic Round (July 2022): $18 M, co-led by a16z Crypto and Variant</p><p>Strategic Round (Aug 2024): $50 M, led by Ribbit Capital with a16z, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera, Brevan Howard, BlockTower, Kraken Ventures, and others</p><p>These funds are supporting growth on Ethereum and expansion to new chains.</p><p><br></p><p>Team Structure and Leadership</p><p>Morpho Labs is structured with both for-profit and nonprofit entities, but engineering is centralized under the development company.</p><p>The engineering organization is divided into smart-contract and off-chain teams. Core protocol development is handled by a small group focused on Morpho Blue, vaults, and oracles. A separate infrastructure/API team manages backend services and the public API. The Head of Engineering will lead this off-chain group and help scale engineering practices.</p><p><br></p><p>Technology Stack and Culture</p><p>Morpho emphasizes security, minimalism, and modern DevOps:</p><p>On-chain: Solidity (Morpho Blue is ~600 LOC), fully audited, formally verified, $2.5M bug bounty</p><p>Off-chain: TypeScript (Node.js), Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, GraphQL API</p><p>Dev Culture: Research-driven, collaborative, with open discussion and weekly “DeFi School” sessions</p><p>Engineers are encouraged to deeply threat-model and simplify systems. Most work is remote-friendly with periodic in-person bootcamps.</p><p>Recent Updates (Past 12 Months)</p><p>Corporate Restructuring: Morpho Labs SAS merged into the Morpho Association nonprofit; all equity transferred to the DAO.</p><p>Coinbase Partnership: Coinbase launched on-chain lending powered by Morpho on Base.</p><p>Token Unlock: MORPHO governance token became transferable in late 2024.</p><p>Growth: Deposits have scaled to ~$6 B; ongoing protocol upgrades and mobile features released.</p><p><br></p><p>Open Source and Community Contributions</p><p>Morpho’s contracts and tools are open source under a dual license. The GitHub organization hosts:</p><p>Morpho Blue (core protocol)</p><p>Vaults, oracles, and rewards contracts</p><p>TypeScript SDKs for integration</p><p>Developer documentation and tooling</p><p>They also regularly publish lending protocol research and offer one of the largest bug bounties in DeFi.</p><p>Locations and Remote Policy</p><p><br></p><p>Morpho Labs is based in Paris, with a remote-friendly culture. Team members work across Europe and North America (GMT-5 to GMT+2 time zones). Roles are open to remote engineers with occasional meetups at the Paris HQ.</p><p><br></p><p>Resources</p><p>Fundraise</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/308866/ribbit-capital-50-million-raise-morpho-labsDune\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theblock.co/post/308866/ribbit-capital-50-million-raise-morpho-labs</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/308866/ribbit-capital-50-million-raise-morpho-labsDune\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dune</a></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://dune.com/morpho/gmorpho-dashboard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://dune.com/morpho/gmorpho-dashboard</a></strong></p><p>Morpho's Mission</p><p><a href=\"https://morpho.mirror.xyz/Df_r4-mDzR-xFLA3P3amuhzwq4GjuuNOnOiiVizx6ZU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://morpho.mirror.xyz/Df_r4-mDzR-xFLA3P3amuhzwq4GjuuNOnOiiVizx6ZU</a></p><p>Nansen - Guide to Morpho</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nansen.ai/post/what-is-morpho\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nansen.ai/post/what-is-morpho</a></p>"
