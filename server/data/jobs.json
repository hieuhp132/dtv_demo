We believe stablecoins will underpin a new financial fabric, one that is faster, more global, and more efficient than today’s siloed systems. That is why we are building AUSD and the Agora stack, a full service platform that makes issuing, managing, and integrating stablecoins seamless – whether you’re a developer, fintech, or institution.

Their core mission is to give users complete ownership and control of their money and digital assets through a secure, self-custodial approach. Unlike many traditional fintech or crypto apps, DeBlock is regulated by the ACPR (Banque de France) and the AMF (Financial Markets Authority), providing a high level of credibility and security.\n\nWhat They Do\nDeblock offers an integrated financial platform that combines the best of both traditional and decentralized finance. The service provides users with:\n\nNon-Custodial Crypto Wallet: A multi-currency wallet that gives users full control over their private keys and digital assets.\n\nIntegrated Banking Services: Each account includes a European IBAN, a physical or virtual debit card, and instant SEPA transfers.\n\nSeamless Crypto-to-Fiat Exchange: Users can easily convert cryptocurrencies to fiat and vice-versa directly within the app, which is a key differentiator from many traditional crypto exchanges.\n\nYield on Digital Assets: The platform provides opportunities to earn a competitive yield (up to 10%) on assets held in vaults.\n\nBusiness Accounts: For businesses, DeBlock offers accounts with multi-signature wallets to enhance security and control over corporate funds.\n\nThe Team\nThe company was founded by a leadership team with deep experience in both traditional fintech and crypto:\n\nJean Meyer, CEO and Co-Founder (ex-Revolut Crypto Chief)\n\nAaron Beck, Co-Founder (ex-Revolut Payment Chief)\n\nMario Eguiliuz, Co-Founder (ex-Ledger Engineering Chief)\n\nAdriana Restrepo, COO (Ex Revolut COO)\n\nThe team's background at major players like Revolut and Ledger highlights their expertise in building scalable, secure, and user-friendly financial products.\n\nFunding\nDeblock has successfully raised a total of $26.1 million in seed funding across several rounds.

Its mission is to make financial infrastructure a public good by providing an open, efficient, and resilient platform for on-chain loans. Morpho enables anyone to earn yield or borrow crypto assets permissionlessly, while also allowing developers and businesses to build custom lending markets and vaults on its infrastructure.</p><p><br></p><p>Since launch, Morpho has grown into one of the largest DeFi lending systems (≈$6 B in deposits as of mid-2025) operating on Ethereum and other chains. Its vision is to become a cornerstone of a new internet-native financial system by fusing DeFi lending with traditional fintech.</p><p><br></p><p>Product Offerings</p><p>Morpho offers a suite of lending/borrowing products and developer tools built around its smart-contract protocol:</p><p><br></p><p>Consumer Products (Earn/Borrow):</p><p>Retail users can deposit assets into Morpho Vaults to earn optimized interest, or post collateral to borrow other tokens. Morpho optimizes yields by peer-to-peer matching within its vaults on top of base pools like Aave/Compound. Borrowers enjoy higher collateral limits and no protocol fees.</p><p><br></p><p>Curate/Vaults (Prime):</p><p>Power users and institutions can deploy custom vaults and lending markets. The Curate interface lets “vault curators” configure collateral types, interest models, and risk parameters, earning fees for supplying liquidity. These vaults are open, customizable, and scalable, benefiting from Morpho’s liquidity and matching engine. This is powered by the “Morpho Blue” protocol — a minimal core lending engine designed for security and flexibility.</p><p><br></p><p>Developer Tools (Infra):</p><p>Morpho provides on-chain and off-chain infrastructure for developers. A public GraphQL API and SDK libraries let applications query Morpho data and integrate lending functions. Enterprises can build their own lending use cases on Morpho’s stack, benefitting from audited, formally-verified contracts and DevOps tools.</p><p><br></p><p>Morpho infrastructure underpins notable integrations — for example, Coinbase’s on-chain lending launched in early 2025 uses Morpho on the Base chain to offer crypto-backed loans through the Coinbase app.</p><p><br></p><p>Funding History</p><p>Morpho Labs has raised approximately $70 M in venture funding (mostly through token sales):</p><p>Seed Round (Oct 2021): ~$1.35 M, led by Semantic Ventures and Nascent</p><p>Strategic Round (July 2022): $18 M, co-led by a16z Crypto and Variant</p><p>Strategic Round (Aug 2024): $50 M, led by Ribbit Capital with a16z, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera, Brevan Howard, BlockTower, Kraken Ventures, and others</p><p>These funds are supporting growth on Ethereum and expansion to new chains.</p><p><br></p><p>Team Structure and Leadership</p><p>Morpho Labs is structured with both for-profit and nonprofit entities, but engineering is centralized under the development company.</p><p>The engineering organization is divided into smart-contract and off-chain teams. Core protocol development is handled by a small group focused on Morpho Blue, vaults, and oracles. A separate infrastructure/API team manages backend services and the public API. The Head of Engineering will lead this off-chain group and help scale engineering practices.</p><p><br></p><p>Technology Stack and Culture</p><p>Morpho emphasizes security, minimalism, and modern DevOps:</p><p>On-chain: Solidity (Morpho Blue is ~600 LOC), fully audited, formally verified, $2.5M bug bounty</p><p>Off-chain: TypeScript (Node.js), Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform, GraphQL API</p><p>Dev Culture: Research-driven, collaborative, with open discussion and weekly “DeFi School” sessions</p><p>Engineers are encouraged to deeply threat-model and simplify systems. Most work is remote-friendly with periodic in-person bootcamps.</p><p>Recent Updates (Past 12 Months)</p><p>Corporate Restructuring: Morpho Labs SAS merged into the Morpho Association nonprofit; all equity transferred to the DAO.</p><p>Coinbase Partnership: Coinbase launched on-chain lending powered by Morpho on Base.</p><p>Token Unlock: MORPHO governance token became transferable in late 2024.</p><p>Growth: Deposits have scaled to ~$6 B; ongoing protocol upgrades and mobile features released.</p><p><br></p><p>Open Source and Community Contributions</p><p>Morpho’s contracts and tools are open source under a dual license. The GitHub organization hosts:</p><p>Morpho Blue (core protocol)</p><p>Vaults, oracles, and rewards contracts</p><p>TypeScript SDKs for integration</p><p>Developer documentation and tooling</p><p>They also regularly publish lending protocol research and offer one of the largest bug bounties in DeFi.</p><p>Locations and Remote Policy</p><p><br></p><p>Morpho Labs is based in Paris, with a remote-friendly culture. Team members work across Europe and North America (GMT-5 to GMT+2 time zones). Roles are open to remote engineers with occasional meetups at the Paris HQ.</p><p><br></p><p>Resources</p><p>Fundraise</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/308866/ribbit-capital-50-million-raise-morpho-labsDune\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.theblock.co/post/308866/ribbit-capital-50-million-raise-morpho-labs</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/308866/ribbit-capital-50-million-raise-morpho-labsDune\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dune</a></p><p><strong><a href=\"https://dune.com/morpho/gmorpho-dashboard\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://dune.com/morpho/gmorpho-dashboard</a></strong></p><p>Morpho's Mission</p><p><a href=\"https://morpho.mirror.xyz/Df_r4-mDzR-xFLA3P3amuhzwq4GjuuNOnOiiVizx6ZU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://morpho.mirror.xyz/Df_r4-mDzR-xFLA3P3amuhzwq4GjuuNOnOiiVizx6ZU</a></p><p>Nansen - Guide to Morpho</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nansen.ai/post/what-is-morpho\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nansen.ai/post/what-is-morpho</a></p>"

From that origin, Arist has evolved into a full-stack, AI-powered enablement platform designed to help enterprises deliver microlearning, training, nudges, surveys, and communications directly in the flow of work—through SMS, Slack, Microsoft Teams, WhatsApp, email, and more. This “push-based” model bypasses traditional LMSs and meets employees where attention already lives. Arist’s strategic vision is ambitious: to become the essential push layer of enterprise enablement—bridging the gap between intent and action, powered by AI agents that handle need analysis, content creation, delivery, and analytics across global teams.</p><p>Company Culture</p><p>Arist’s culture is deeply rooted in mission-driven innovation and pragmatic impact. The company is built around the belief that learning should be frictionless and embedded within everyday workflows—reflecting a nimble, outcome-oriented mindset. The team prioritizes asynchronous, thoughtful communication (memo-driven), rapid iteration aided by AI, and high standards of enterprise reliability. This culture is shaped less by buzzwords and more by their collective focus on solving real, measurable business problems.</p><p><br></p><h2><strong>What you can expect</strong></h2><h3>Day to Day</h3><p>You’ll spend your days designing and refining user experiences across Arist’s admin and learner platforms — from initial research to polished UI. You’ll work closely with Maxine (Co-founder &amp; Head of Product and Engineering) and the engineering team to translate insights into intuitive workflows and scalable systems. Most days involve a mix of user interviews, wireframing, design reviews, and close collaboration with engineers to ensure high-quality execution. Expect fast feedback loops, tight iteration cycles, and the ability to see your work ship quickly to enterprise customers.</p><h3>Team</h3><p>You’ll join a lean, highly technical founding team, reporting directly to the CTO and collaborating closely with the CEO and product leads. The team is composed of engineers with backgrounds in AI/ML, backend systems, and enterprise software, all focused on building production-grade AI enablement tools. You’ll have significant ownership and autonomy, with the ability to shape architecture, standards, and culture.</p><h3>Growth</h3><p>This is a senior, high-impact role with room to grow into design leadership as Arist scales.
