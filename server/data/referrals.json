    "suitability": "* Year of birth: 25/07/1998\r\n* Nationality: Argentina \r\n* Languages spoken: Spanish (native) - English (B1-B2, learning)\r\n* Earliest available start date: right now\r\n* Expected salary:\r\n* Your Linkedin:\r\n* Rust Proficiency (Blockchain context): almost 3 years\r\n* Solana Experience: more than 2 years\r\n\r\nYes, I'm using Rust every day in Blockchain projects. I'm Rust Smart Contract Developer using Anchor mainly.\r\nI worked on situations where many accounts could be changed in the same transaction. To keep it safe, I use Rust’s ownership system, which makes sure memory and access are handled correctly. Also, Anchor with its macros and constraints helps a lot, because it makes account validation easier and avoids common mistakes with concurrency and memory.\r\nMaybe there are two projects on Solana where I implemented an important piece of logic. The first one, I had to develop a staking program, where I had to calculate manually each reward taking extreme care regarding overflows, underflows, etc. I used SPL, to receive/hold, transfer and mint tokens.\r\nAnd maybe the second one was a program where I had to receive SOL and swap as many random tokens as I could (randombag.fun). And the problem here was that I had to do that in only one tx, so I had to manage each random account by remaining accounts manually and implement ALTs (https://solana.com/es/developers/guides/advanced/lookup-tables), increment the CU limit and use a custom allocator heap because the tx was very heavy in each way.\r\n\r\nYes, I have more than 2 years of experience as Solana Smart Contract Engineer using Anchor framework. The biggest challenge maybe was to successfully develop randombag.fun because each limit was reached when I wanted to swap as many tokens as I could. But reading the documentation, asking/reading the Solana forums and with a lot of debugging and testing was done successfully.\r\nYes, I have experience with SPL. Almost all projects use tokens, so I use SPL in almost all projects. And SPL extensions too, the most common is Metadata extension by Metaplex and also used Transfer Hook extension and cNFT (compressed NFTs). These last two were by testing projects.\r\n\r\nI didn't contribute to any big open-source blockchain project. I just contributed in a Colosseum Hackathon project in the past edition of the Boltick project (boltick.com.ar). I had to \"audit\" with a lot of testing the Anchor program and solve some problems in the code. Mainly I did testing using Typescript and Rust. And when I found some bugs and security problems I fix these problems on the Anchor program.\r\n\r\nAnchor snippet to create a simple mint:\r\n// instructions/create_mint.rs file\r\n#[derive(Accounts)]\r\npub struct CreateMint<'info> {\r\n    #[account(mut)]\r\n    pub signer: Signer<'info>,\r\n\r\n    #[account(\r\n        init,\r\n        payer = signer,\r\n        mint::decimals = 9,\r\n        mint::authority = signer.key(),\r\n        mint::freeze_authority = signer.key(),\r\n    )]\r\n    pub mint: InterfaceAccount<'info, Mint>,\r\n\r\n    pub token_program: Interface<'info, TokenInterface>,\r\n    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,\r\n}\r\n    \r\nimpl <'info> CreateMint<'info> {\r\n    pub fn crete_mint(&mut self) -> Result<()> {\r\n        Ok(())\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// lib.rs file\r\n... inside the mod program\r\n    \r\npub fn create_mint(ctx: Context<CreateMint>) -> Result<()> {\r\n    ctx.accounts.create_mint()\r\n    \r\n// ... continue with the file\r\n}\r\n\r\nI look forward to your reply.\r\nExpected salary: 120K USD annually",

    "suitability": "Thank you for considering my application for the Sr. Full-Stack Engineer role at Revic. After reviewing the job description, I am even more excited about the opportunity to contribute to your mission of transforming GTM data into actionable insights. Please find my responses below:\r\n\r\nWork location & model\r\nI am currently based in the Virginia, U.S. and open to relocating. My preference would be the New York office, and I can commit to the hybrid schedule (3 days/week in office). If relocation is required, I would plan to move within a week of an offer.\r\n\r\nAvailability\r\nI am available to start as early as October 2025.\r\n\r\nScreening questions\r\n\r\nRecent technology/skill learned:\r\nMost recently, I deepened my expertise in Python FastAPI and AWS serverless orchestration. I applied these skills to build scalable APIs and workflows for internal dashboards at Amazon, integrating data from multiple sources while ensuring low latency and reliability. I also upskilled in Power BI and advanced SQL, which I used to design analytics dashboards that helped leadership track real-time deliverables and risks.\r\n\r\nFeature/system built:\r\nAt Amazon, I designed and delivered a bulk upload feature and control panel for the Frisco & Flexico deliverables management dashboards (React + Python backend). This system replaced a manual, error-prone workflow with an automated pipeline that reduced processing time from several hours to minutes. It improved adoption across multiple teams and drove a 40% increase in efficiency and measurable gains in on-time deliverables.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding of Revic’s product & market:\r\nRevic is building next-generation GTM intelligence tools by leveraging AI, machine learning, and sales/revenue operations data. I see Revic as uniquely positioned to help organizations unify messy CRM and RevOps data, turning it into clear models, scoring, and insights that drive sales effectiveness. My experience designing control panels, risk dashboards, and AI/ML-powered data workflows aligns directly with this mission. I would love to learn more about how Revic envisions agent orchestration and context-graph applications in production.\r\n\r\nWhy early-stage startup:\r\nI thrive in environments where I can wear multiple hats, move quickly, and take full ownership of systems. Early-stage startups demand adaptability, initiative, and resilience , qualities I have honed through building complex dashboards at Amazon, managing CR deliverables, and contributing to academic projects where I handled both backend and frontend responsibilities end-to-end. I am drawn to Revic’s mission because I enjoy contributing not just code, but also product ideas, architectural improvements, and process standards.\r\n\r\nHybrid location (KO):\r\nI would plan to work from the New York office 3 days/week, relocating immediately if necessary.\r\n\r\nWork authorization (KO):\r\nI currently hold valid U.S. work authorization and can start immediately without sponsorship. For the long term, if the collaboration proves a strong fit, I would be open to continuing through either a third-party arrangement or direct sponsorship.\r\n\r\nPersonal details\r\nYear of birth: 2000\r\nNationality: Indian\r\nLanguages: English, Telugu, Hindi\r\nExpected salary range: $120,000 – $140,000 (flexible depending on equity and benefits).\r\n\r\nWhy I am a strong fit for Revic\r\nWith over 5 years of experience in Python, React/TypeScript,  Spring Boot, Angular, SQL, Power BI, and AWS cloud infrastructure, I have delivered enterprise-scale applications that balance usability, scalability, and reliability. My recent work has focused on:\r\n\r\nFrontend excellence: Implementing React/TypeScript tables, filters, and dashboards with a focus on user experience and accessibility.\r\n\r\nBackend/API design: Developing Python services and APIs with validations, integrations, and data modeling across large datasets.\r\n\r\nCloud + orchestration: Building AWS-based solutions, containerized workloads, and automation pipelines.\r\n\r\nAI/ML interest: Integrating analytics and exploring AI-powered frameworks such as Haystack for retrieval and workflow orchestration.\r\n\r\nI believe this combination of full-stack expertise, startup mindset, and enterprise discipline positions me to add immediate value at Revic while growing with your platform long-term.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the opportunity to discuss next steps.",

The time that you can onboard? 2 weeks\r\n \r\nII>Let's go through a few questions to confirm your suitability: \r\n \r\n1. What’s the most recent technology or skill you taught yourself, and how did you apply it?\r\n--- Most recently I taught myself how to containerize projects with Docker. I applied to CI/CD pipelines, running automated tests in an isolated environment, deploying the bundled container image to servers, for consistency.\r\n \r\n2. Describe a feature/system you built. What problem did it solve, and what metrics improved? \r\n--- At Just Right Reader, I built a data aggregation tool with Node.js and React that let analysts upload spreadsheets and automatically receive cleaned, structured data for sales fulfillment. Previously, this was done manually and was error-prone. The tool cut processing time from hours to minutes, reduced mistakes by over 80%, and gave the sales team faster access to accurate data, directly improving turnaround for customer orders. \r\n \r\n3. What do you understand about Revic’s product and market? What questions do you have? \r\n--- From what I gather, Revic is using AI to pull together a lot of scattered sales data and then help revenue teams act on it automatically. It sounds like the idea is to cut down the busywork in CRMs and dashboards so reps can spend more time actually selling. I’m not fully sure yet how that looks day to day for a rep, but it seems like a big opportunity since almost every company struggles with sales execution. I'm curious about a few things:\r\n What does a rep actually experience when using Revic. Does it feel like an assistant, or more like automated updates in the background?\r\nHow do you handle messy or incomplete data coming from different systems? \r\nWhat are some challenges that someone coming into this role can help address. \r\n \r\n4. Why do you want to work at an early-stage startup? What does it take to succeed there? \r\n--- I want to work at an early-stage startup because I enjoy having ownership, moving quickly, and seeing my work directly impact customers. To succeed, I think it takes adaptability, a bias for action, and the ability to work with ambiguity, shipping fast, learning, and iterating while keeping the bigger picture in mind. \r\n \r\n5. Hybrid location (KO): Which office (San Francisco, NYC, Vancouver) can you work from 3 days/week? If relocating, what’s the timeline? \r\n--- I can work out of the NYC office 3 day/week.\r\n \r\n6. Work authorization (KO): Do you currently have work authorization (US/Canada) without sponsorship? \r\n--- I am a U.S. Citizen.",

Let's go through a few questions to confirm your suitability for this position:\r\n1. How many years in DevOps/Platform/SRE roles operating production systems? Detail?\r\nI have nearly 4 years of hands-on experience in DevOps/Platform roles operating production systems on AWS/GCP and Kubernetes. My work has included leading the migration of 80+ services from ECS to EKS, managing large-scale production clusters, participating in on-call rotations, resolving incidents with root cause analysis, and implementing observability stacks with Datadog, Prometheus, and Grafana. I’ve also been directly involved in SOC 2 compliance and security guardrails.\r\n\r\n2. Are you strong Terraform and Terragrunt experience (module design, environment orchestration, CI validation)? Detail?\r\nI have strong Terraform expertise, designing reusable modules and automated templates to standardize infrastructure deployments across multiple environments. I integrated Terraform with CI pipelines for validation and consistency. While I don't have direct experience with Terragrunt specifically, my experience with Terraform module design and orchestration makes me confident in adopting and working with Terragrunt in a similar capacity.\r\n\r\n3. Kubernetes (preferably EKS) operations and Helm proficiency? Detail?\r\nYes — I have extensive experience operating EKS clusters for both production/staging/development for common workloads and AI/ML workloads. I optimized scalability and performance using Karpenter, enforced security with IAM and VPC policies, and led cost reduction initiatives. I also standardized deployments using Helm and Kustomize, creating reusable charts and managing automated rollouts and upgrades.\r\n\r\n4. Hands-on ArgoCD and GitOps workflows? Detail?\r\nI’ve implemented GitOps pipelines with ArgoCD and Gitlab CI, reducing Kubernetes deployment times and ensuring consistent environments. I integrated approval workflows via JIRA to enhance governance and auditability.\r\n\r\n5. GitLab CI experience building reusable pipelines with templates and includes? Detail?\r\nYes — I’ve used GitLab CI to build reusable pipelines with templates, and standardization across projects. I’ve also worked with GitHub Actions and Jenkins, but GitLab CI was central in building automation for deployments, infrastructure validation, and CI/CD workflows at scale.\r\n\r\n6. Are you proficient in Bash; Python?\r\nYes — I can work well with both Bash and Python, and also Golang. I’ve written Python automation scripts for CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure workflows, and maintained an internal ML system, and I’ve used Bash extensively for system automation, scripting, and environment setup.\r\n\r\n7. Solid Linux and networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, TLS)?\r\nYes — I have Linux administration skills, including automation, and security hardening. I also have deep experience with networking fundamentals: configuring VPCs, IAM policies, DNS with Route 53, TLS termination, and troubleshooting incidents related to TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and TLS.\r\n\r\n8. Practical AWS experience: EC2, EKS, IAM, VPC, ALB/NLB, Route 53, S3, CloudWatch?\r\nYes — I’ve managed AWS production environments extensively:\r\n- EKS: operated and scaled clusters for production and AI/ML workloads.\r\n- EC2: provisioned and optimized compute resources.\r\n- IAM & VPC: designed and enforced secure access and network segmentation.\r\n- ALB/NLB & Route 53: managed ingress, DNS, and service routing.\r\n- S3: used for storage, backups, images storage and important data.\r\n- CloudWatch & Datadog: built observability solutions for monitoring, logging, and metrics.\r\n\r\nI also delivered significant cost optimizations (30% savings) through automation, right-sizing, and scaling optimizations.

(Yes/No + details): Yes, I am able to relocate within an agreed timeline.\r\nExpected salary: 140K-150K\r\n\r\nMinimum Requirements\r\n1. Do you have 4+ years of experience building and owning backend/platform systems end-to-end? Yes, I have over four years of experience as a full-stack engineer, and the core of my roles has been building and owning backend and platform systems end-to-end. At both JazzB AI and CereBulb, I was responsible for architecting and deploying Python-based microservices using Django and FastAPI. This included designing scalable data models in PostgreSQL, implementing secure REST APIs, and orchestrating asynchronous workflows using RabbitMQ and Redis for high performance.\r\n2. Have you worked at an early-stage, high-growth startup or founded/built your own project? Yes, I have extensive experience in early-stage, high-growth startups, specifically at JazzB AI and CereBulb, Scaleteam. This experience means I thrive in environments that require high agency and a bias toward action. I took direct ownership of full-stack product development, often building features from a \"zero-to-one\" concept to a fully deployed production system, and constantly balanced speed with stability.\r\n3. Have you not applied to Revic before? Yes, I have not applied to Revic before, and I am highly focused on this opportunity.\r\n4. Are you able to work hybrid (3 days/week) in San Francisco, New York City, or Vancouver (or relocate within an agreed timeline)? Yes\r\n5. Do you have production experience with React + Python? Yes, I have extensive production experience with the React + Python stack. I used Python with Django and FastAPI to build secure, high-throughput backend APIs and used React.js with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS to craft the highly responsive, user-facing applications. This combination is my strongest area of expertise for building scalable platforms\r\n\r\nAdditional Details\r\n1. Relevant Role: Software Engineer\r\n2. Relevant Company: JazzB AI\r\n3. Experience Summary: Full-stack Software Engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance applications using Python (Django, FastAPI) and JavaScript/TypeScript with React.js. I have hands-on experience in AI integration, data engineering, and deploying cloud-native applications on AWS, demonstrating a strong bias for action in fast-paced startup environments.\r\n4. Requires Sponsorship? Optional\r\n5. Resume (PDF): Attached\r\n\r\nScreening Questions\r\n1. Video Walkthrough: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nvkzcYtdWKTfKRciMJyQJLeyAG689nye/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n2. GitHub link: https://github.com/dgchovatiya\r\n\r\n3. What is the most recent technology or skill you taught yourself, and how did you apply it? The most recent skill I taught myself was LLM orchestration. I applied this to build a RAG pipeline that provided a multi-agent system with access to a domain-specific knowledge base. This was essential for our AI agent to produce accurate and relevant content without hallucinating.\r\n\r\n4. Describe a feature or system you built. What problem did it solve for users or the business, and what metrics improved? At JazzB AI, I built a full-stack platform centered around an AI agent designed to automate SEO content generation. The problem was that creating high-quality, keyword-optimized content was a manual and time-consuming process. The system I built connected an LLM (specifically OpenAI and Gemini) with a database of SEO insights via a custom RAG pipeline, allowing the agent to generate tailored, data-driven content. This solution reduced our manual marketing sync efforts by over 60% and increased user workflow efficiency by 3x.\r\n\r\n5. What do you understand about Revic’s product and market? What questions do you have about our approach? Based on my understanding, Revic is an early-stage, high-growth startup building a full-stack platform. I'm excited by the opportunity to apply my skills in an environment that values speed and a bias for action. I'd like to learn more about the specific challenges you're currently facing and how you see the role evolving as the company scales.\r\n\r\n6. Why do you want to work at an early-stage startup? What do you believe it takes to succeed in such an environment? I am passionate about working at early-stage startups because I thrive in environments that require high ownership and a hands-on approach. To succeed, I believe it takes a combination of technical expertise, adaptability, and a relentless bias for action. The ability to tackle ambiguity, learn quickly, and collaborate closely with a small, mission-driven team is essential.\r\n\r\n7. Hybrid location: Comfortable\r\n8. Work Authorization: OPT\r\n9.

    "suitability": "My salary expectation for this role is $3,000 - $5,000\r\nI can onboard within 2-4 weeks\r\nFluent (C1 level)\r\n1. How many years of experience as a Backend or Full-stack Engineer, handling projects of various complexities? \r\n I have over 10 years of experience as a Backend and Full-stack Engineer, managing projects ranging from high-traffic SaaS platforms supporting 50,000+ monthly active users (at Descartes Systems Group) to scalable microservices architectures for Web3 e-commerce systems (at TechBit Solutions). This includes leading teams, optimizing performance under peak loads, and delivering secure, real-time applications across fintech and logistics domains.\r\n\r\n2. Are highly proficient with Ruby on Rails? Detail? \r\n Yes, I am highly proficient with Ruby on Rails, with approximately 4 years of hands-on experience from my time at Innovatech Solutions (2017-2020), where I used RoR to build a robust backend for a logistics management system handling 10,000+ daily transactions with 99.9% uptime. I architected RESTful APIs, implemented authentication layers, and integrated with PostgreSQL using ActiveRecord for efficient data modeling and migrations. More recently, I've maintained proficiency through side projects involving Rails for SaaS prototypes, ensuring I stay current with best practices like TDD and CI/CD integration.\r\n\r\n3. Have experience working with Javascript? Detail? \r\n Yes, I have extensive experience with JavaScript (ES6+), spanning over 10 years across full-stack roles. At TechBit Solutions, I developed reusable React components with Tailwind CSS for a Web3 e-commerce frontend, improving development efficiency by 30%. At Wave Financial, I created dynamic dashboards enhancing data visualization for enterprise users, and at Descartes Systems Group, I integrated JS with Nest.js backends for real-time features. My work emphasizes performance optimization, state management with Redux, and seamless API integrations via GraphQL and REST.\r\n\r\n4. Have strong experience working with relational databases, mainly PostgreSQL, and ORM libraries like ActiveRecord? Detail? \r\n Absolutely, I have strong experience with relational databases, particularly PostgreSQL, used in over 8 years of projects, along with ORM libraries including ActiveRecord. In my RoR work at Innovatech Solutions, I designed PostgreSQL schemas with ActiveRecord for complex joins and queries in a transaction-heavy logistics system, ensuring data integrity and scalability. At TechBit Solutions, I led PostgreSQL implementations in AWS Lambda microservices, reducing costs by 25% through query optimization. I've also worked with Django's ORM and SQLAlchemy in Python backends, handling migrations, indexing, and caching with Redis for high-performance applications.\r\n\r\n**Bonus Points:**\r\n\r\n1. Commercial experience with React/React Native? Detail? \r\n Yes, I have 8+ years of commercial experience with React (though not React Native specifically). At Descartes Systems Group, I built high-traffic SaaS frontends with React and TypeScript, supporting zero-downtime peak loads for 50,000+ users. At Innovatech Solutions, I developed responsive interfaces that boosted user retention by 15%, and at TechBit Solutions, I created component-driven UIs for real-time collaborative apps integrated with Supabase. I'm eager to extend this to React Native for any mobile needs at Landed.\r\n\r\n2. Experience or is willing to learn Hotwire / Stimulus? Detail? \r\n While I haven't worked directly with Hotwire or Stimulus yet, I have relevant experience with Turbo (a Hotwire component) in Rails prototypes and am very willing—and excited—to learn them quickly. My background in server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js and real-time updates via WebSockets positions me well to adopt these for enhancing Rails apps with minimal JavaScript, aligning with my growth mindset.\r\n\r\n3. Experience in the FinTech or SaaS space? Detail? \r\n Yes, I have substantial experience in both FinTech and SaaS. In FinTech, at Wave Financial (2014-2017), I contributed to a Node.js/PostgreSQL CRM platform for 500+ enterprise users, focusing on secure data visualization and system migrations to GCP. For SaaS, at Descartes Systems Group (2021-2024), I led Nest.js/GraphQL development for a high-traffic platform with advanced JWT/OAuth security for financial services, optimizing MongoDB/Redis for 40% faster responses and launching major features on schedule. These roles honed my skills in scalable, secure solutions—perfect for Landed's mission.",

    "suitability": "1. NYC, us citizen\r\n2. i live here\r\n3. I recently architected and deployed a full-stack Node.js/React/TypeScript dashboard at Fubo that integrated financial and operational APIs, where I enforced integrity through idempotent API calls, schema validation, and PostgreSQL constraints, while caching and load balancing ensured sub-second response times at scale; on the AI side, I’ve productionized OpenAI GPT-4 with LangChain-style orchestration, embedding pipelines, and RAG retrieval using pgvector, building tools that classified issues, summarized transactions, and automated analysis with strict schema-based outputs, caching, and observability in Datadog, which reduced troubleshooting by 60% and cut resolution times by 85%, giving me direct, hands-on experience with both financial data systems and LLM deployment in production\r\n5. I’ve been hands-on with prompt engineering by treating prompts like code—versioning them, testing variants, and tightening outputs with JSON schemas and role-based instructions so models behave predictably in production. For tool use orchestration, I’ve gone beyond LangChain and built lightweight, explicit routers (similar to MCP concepts) where the model decides when to call APIs, fetch vector search results, or hit internal services, while I control retries, fallbacks, and logging for observability. On AI agent design, I’ve developed multi-step agents that retrieve financial or operational data, analyze it, and then generate structured recommendations or summaries, with safeguards like confidence thresholds and “can’t verify” fallbacks to avoid hallucinations. This blend of structured prompts, controlled tool orchestration, and careful agent flow design has allowed me to ship LLM-powered features that actually stick in production and cut manual workload by more than half.\r\n6. The largest React frontend I’ve built was at Fubo, where I led development of a high-performance dashboard used by internal teams to monitor live video streams and financial/operational metrics. It was a multi-page React/TypeScript application with real-time data feeds, custom charting, and role-based access, serving hundreds of concurrent users daily. I managed state with Redux and context selectors for performance, used memoization to cut unnecessary re-renders, and implemented caching and pagination for API-driven views. To keep things smooth at scale, I also broke the app into modular components, applied code-splitting, and worked closely with backend teams to optimize API payloads. The result was sub-second load times and a 30% increase in retention from streamlined operations.\r\n7. I kept state lean by separating API data from UI data—Redux and RTK Query handled server state with caching and revalidation, while local UI state stayed in hooks. To boost performance, I cut re-renders with memoization, virtualized big tables, used code-splitting, and offloaded heavy computations to web workers. Real-time interactivity came through WebSockets with delta updates, heartbeat checks, and optimistic UI that reconciled when the server confirmed, which kept dashboards fast and reliable under heavy load.\r\n9. \r\n10.

I primarily work remotely.\r\n\r\n2-I built a full-stack system that integrated with financial APIs to process transactions, validate balances, and provide user dashboards. On the backend (Python/Flask + PostgreSQL), I implemented strict schema validation, idempotency checks, and database transactions to guarantee data consistency. On the frontend (React), I optimized API requests with caching and pagination. For performance, I used asynchronous workers (Celery/Kafka) to handle heavy computations and introduced monitoring/alerts to ensure reliability under high load.\r\n\r\n3-I have hands-on production experience with LLMs and LangChain. I’ve built RAG pipelines that connect vector databases (Pinecone, FAISS) with LLMs for context-aware responses, deployed in AWS. I also integrated prompt templates, retrievers, and toolchains to support business workflows, including customer support automation and document intelligence.\r\n\r\n4- I’ve worked extensively with prompt engineering — designing reusable templates, handling edge cases, and testing systematically. With tool use orchestration (similar to MCP concepts), I structured AI agents that decide when to call APIs, query databases, or escalate to humans. In agent design, I focus on modularity and guardrails, ensuring predictable behavior and fallback mechanisms in production.\r\n\r\n5-The largest React-based frontend I built served thousands of users with real-time dashboards. For state management, I used Redux Toolkit with normalized slices, and in performance-critical areas I applied React Query for data fetching and caching. To support real-time interactivity, I used WebSockets/EventBridge for live updates, optimized rendering with memoization and lazy loading, and split bundles to reduce initial load times.\r\n\r\n6-Brazilian.\r\n\r\n7-Portuguese (native), English (fluent)\r\n\r\n8-I’m available to start immediately.\r\n\r\n9-For PJ contracts, my expected range is USD $4,000–6,000/month, depending on scope and responsibilities.",

Specialized in React.js, Vue.js, Node.js, Javascript, Typescript, I build high-performance interfaces with clean code and UX focus. My background includes working with large-scale enterprise squads, contributing to agile teams, and leading front-end architecture in projects with high technical complexity. \r\n\r\n2 - Yes, I have extensive experience building large-scale applications with Javascript (Typescript) + React. At Vivo (my current project), I led the architecture of a unified e-commerce platform using React + TS + Redux + Jest + Cypress for 6 million monthly users.\r\n\r\n3 - Yes. While not a primary focus of my architectural role, I have practical, hands-on experience with Webpack. It was the underlying build tool in the React and Vue projects I've worked on, and I'm comfortable configuring it for optimization tasks.\r\n\r\n4 - Yes. While my most recent work involved designing a GraphQL API for a Node.js BFF, I have extensive experience both designing (back-end) and consuming (front-end) RESTful APIs throughout my career. My focus is always on creating clear, consistent, and well-documented endpoints.\r\n\r\n# Bonus points:\r\n1 - Yes, I have hands-on experience with both. I have deep expertise in GraphQL, having designed and built a GraphQL API from scratch for a Node.js BFF service. This was crucial for optimizing data fetching for our React front-end. I also have professional experience with PostgreSQL, which we used at Empiricus to manage structured data for our subscriber platform. I'm very comfortable using SQL for data integrity and GraphQL for flexible and efficient client-server communication.\r\n\r\n2 - I don't have direct experience with Relay, but, I learn fast, so it's no problem for me.\r\n\r\n3 - While my professional roles have been with larger companies, I've often worked in fast-paced teams that operate like startups. Additionally, I have experience building products from scratch through my personal projects, like an AI-powered travel planner, which gave me a strong sense of the ownership and speed required in an early-stage environment.\r\n\r\n4 - Docker: Yes, I use Docker in my daily workflow to create consistent development environments.\r\nKubernetes: I have a conceptual understanding but no hands-on professional experience.\r\nMaterial UI: While I haven't used Material UI specifically, I have extensive experience creating component libraries and Design Systems with Storybook, so I'm very comfortable with component-based UI frameworks.\r\nData Visualizations: Yes, I have experience building data-rich dashboards, such as the platform for 400,000 subscribers at Empiricus.",

    "suitability": " My full name is Fredi Leonardo Gomez, and I was born in 1978.\r\n2. What is your salary expectation (gross)?\r\n My salary expectation is $60,000 USD gross annually, based on my senior-level expertise in full-stack development, including Web3 integrations and high-traffic SaaS platforms.\r\n3. The time that you can onboard?\r\n I can onboard immediately, as my previous contract at TechBit Solutions concluded in August 2025, and I'm fully available to start contributing right away.\r\n4. Your English?\r\n My English proficiency is fluent at C1 level, allowing me to communicate complex technical concepts effectively in multicultural teams, as demonstrated during my roles in Canada and Colombia.\r\n\r\nII> Let's go through a few questions to confirm your suitability for this position:\r\n\r\n1. How many years of Software Engineering experience? Detail?\r\n I have over 11 years of professional software engineering experience, starting from my junior role at Wave Financial in 2014 where I contributed to Node.js-based CRM platforms handling enterprise-scale data. This progressed to full-stack positions at Innovatech Solutions (2017-2020), where I designed Django backends for logistics systems processing 10,000+ daily transactions with 99.9% uptime, incorporating advanced caching mechanisms and asynchronous task queues using Celery and RabbitMQ. At Descartes Systems Group (2021-2024), I led the architecture of a zero-downtime SaaS platform using Nest.js and GraphQL, scaling to 50,000+ monthly active users through optimized sharding and load balancing. Most recently at TechBit Solutions (2025), I architected a Web3 e-commerce platform with Solidity smart contracts integrated into Next.js frontends, employing microservices on AWS Lambda for cost-efficient scaling that reduced server expenses by 25%.\r\n2. Do you have experience building large applications with Javascript, React and Redux?\r\n Yes, I have extensive experience building large-scale applications with JavaScript, React, and Redux. For instance, at Descartes Systems Group, I developed a high-traffic SaaS dashboard using React and Redux for state management, implementing thunk middleware for asynchronous API calls and immutable state updates to handle real-time financial data feeds for 50,000+ users, resulting in 40% faster response times via memoized selectors and normalized data structures. In my TechBit role, I created reusable React components with Redux Toolkit for a collaborative task management app, integrating Supabase for real-time synchronization and employing Redux Persist for offline capabilities, which boosted development efficiency by 30% through component-driven architecture and hooks like useSelector and useDispatch.\r\n3. Do you have experience with webpack or browserify? Detail?\r\n Yes, I have hands-on experience with Webpack, which I've preferred over Browserify for its modular configuration and plugin ecosystem. At Innovatech Solutions, I configured Webpack for a React-based logistics frontend, enabling code-splitting, tree-shaking, and lazy loading to reduce bundle sizes by 25%, incorporating Babel for ES6+ transpilation and Terser for minification. In a recent freelance project (2025), I used Webpack 5 with Module Federation to create a micro-frontend architecture, allowing dynamic module loading across distributed teams, which streamlined deployments and improved initial load times by 35% compared to monolithic builds.\r\n4. Do you have experience designing REST APIs? Detail?\r\n Yes, I've designed numerous REST APIs with a focus on scalability, security, and adherence to OpenAPI specifications. At Wave Financial, I built RESTful endpoints in Node.js for a CRM system, using Express.js with middleware for rate limiting, CORS, and JWT authentication, handling CRUD operations on PostgreSQL with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. More advanced work at Descartes included designing versioned APIs with HATEOAS principles in Nest.js, incorporating pagination, filtering, and sorting via query parameters, and integrating Swagger for auto-generated documentation, which facilitated seamless integrations for financial services and reduced API errors by 40% through comprehensive error handling and response schemas.\r\n\r\nBonus points if you:\r\n1. Do you have SQL, Postgres Graphql experience? Detail?\r\n Yes, I have deep experience with SQL, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL. At Innovatech, I optimized PostgreSQL queries for a logistics backend, using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to index composite keys and implement window functions for real-time analytics on 10,000+ transactions daily, achieving sub-100ms query times. In GraphQL, at Descartes, I built federated schemas with Apollo Server, resolving complex nested queries and mutations for user authentication and data aggregation, leveraging dataloaders to mitigate N+1 problems and integrating with PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM for type-safe queries.\r\n2. Relay experience? Detail?\r\n Yes, I've worked with Relay for GraphQL client-side management in React applications. In a 2023 side project for a decentralized voting app (built on my Solidity expertise), I used Relay to compile GraphQL queries at build time, implementing fragment colocation and pagination with connections/edges for efficient data fetching, which minimized over-fetching and integrated seamlessly with Redux for global state, resulting in a 50% reduction in network payloads compared to vanilla Apollo Client.\r\n3. Early stage startup experience? Detail?\r\n Yes, I have early-stage startup experience, notably at TechBit Solutions in 2025, where as one of the first engineering hires, I bootstrapped the entire Web3 e-commerce platform from MVP to production, wearing multiple hats including defining the tech stack (Next.js, Node.js, Solidity), setting up CI/CD with Jenkins, and iterating rapidly based on user feedback in an Agile environment with weekly sprints, which accelerated time-to-market by 40% and secured initial funding through a demo that showcased blockchain-secured transactions.\r\n4. Do you have experience using Docker/Kubernetes, Material UI and Data visualizations? Detail?\r\n Yes, I have substantial experience with Docker/Kubernetes, Material UI, and data visualizations. For containerization, at Descartes, I dockerized microservices using multi-stage builds for Nest.js apps, orchestrating them on Kubernetes with Helm charts for auto-scaling pods based on CPU metrics, achieving zero-downtime deployments via rolling updates. With Material UI, I've styled enterprise dashboards in React projects, customizing themes and components like DataGrid for responsive layouts, as in my Innovatech role where it improved UI consistency and accessibility scores. For data visualizations, at Wave Financial, I integrated D3.js and Recharts within React/Redux setups to create interactive charts for CRM analytics, handling large datasets with Web Workers for smooth rendering and zoom/pan interactions, enhancing user insights and retention by 15%.",

Advanced, I have been working with US companies for the past 3 years and have studied English since I was a child.\r\n\r\nII>Let's go through a few questions to confirm your suitability for this position:\r\n1. How many years of Software Engineering experience? Detail?\r\nOver 6 years, started as fullstack in a startup environment, transitioned to being Frontend focused. I have led and mentored engineers and was responsible for architecture designs.

Do you have experience with webpack or browserify? Detail?\r\nWebpack. I conducted the migration of a legacy project at Energage, modernized the bundle to webpack 5. I considered using Vite, but webpack had features that were essential to the project. That migration resulted in a 70% reduction of assets being served to the client.\r\n4. Do you have experience designing REST APIs? Detail?\r\nI have experience when working with Ruby on Rails, which follows MVC.

Last year, I studied DDD and Clean Architecture in depth.\r\nBonus points if you:\r\n1. Do you have SQL, Postgres Graphql experience? Detail?\r\nMostly SQL. I worked extensively with it when working with Ruby on Rails. Even though we used its native ORM, I often built complex queries, especially for data analysis. GraphQL I have minimal experience.\r\n2. Relay experience? Detail?\r\nRelay, I don’t have experience.\r\n3. Early stage startup experience? Detail?\r\nYes, I was the first hire for a local ecommerce in Ruby on Rails, had to wear different hats, work in the frontend, backend, run the clusters at Heroku, fix pipelines.\r\n4. Do you have experience using Docker/Kubernetes, Material UI and Data visualizations? Detail?\r\nWhen migrating an MVP to modern React I used Material UI and Docker to set up the environment. I have also used Docker in other projects.\r\nFor Data Visualizations, I have experience using Visx, which is based on the D3.js library. I have used it extensively to create charts over the past few years.",

    "suitability": "Can you share your experience with APAC communities and social platforms? What do you see as the biggest differences when building communities in this region?\t\"As part of the marketing agency that I currently work with, I've worked directly with clients to build their APAC community strategy and also optimize their APAC KOL strategy.\r\n\r\nThe biggest differences that I see in the region is that every country has its own unique culture and preferred communication methods. For example, Koreans are primarily on Telegram and find their alpha in Telegram groups. So the ways that you measure a Korean KOLs success will be different from measuring a Western KOLs success as the methods are different.\"\r\nHow many followers do you currently have on X (Twitter)? What kind of content do you usually share, and how is the engagement?\tHave roughly 2000 followers. I usually share content on communities that I'm an active member in - Pudgy Penguins, Abstract Chain, Mythos Foundation. I also share thoughts on the market and any project that I personally find interesting. \r\nHave you worked directly with KOLs, creators, or contributors across multiple platforms? Could you provide a specific example of how you collaborated and managed them? Besides English, which major APAC language(s) are you fluent in (Mandarin, Korean, Japanese, Bahasa, Vietnamese, etc.)? How have you used this language in a professional context?\t\"Yes, I have done 360 KOL management - from recruitment, negotiation, to managing KOL deliverables. For example, one client wanted a KOL campaign out in one week. I urgently found KOLs that I already have relationships with, presented them the client's blurb, and negotiated their fee all within a few days to ensure the client got the activation that they were after.\r\nI am advanced in Korean (heading towards fluency) and fluent in Tagalog. I have used Korean to make connections that foreigners cannot usually make without knowing Korean. This has led to Korean KOLs trusting me as well since I can understand what their saying and reduce any risk of them \"\"losing face\"\" when it comes to communication.\"\r\nHave you worked at a large blockchain foundation or a traditional financial institution? If yes, what was your role and what were your key achievements?\tI currently moderate for Internet Computer(ICP)'s Telegram community. The community is currently a community of over 10,000 members with community hubs spread across all continents.\r\nHave you ever built or scaled communities for a Layer 1 blockchain or a large-scale DeFi project? What specific results did you achieve?\tWhile I haven't specifically scaled DeFi projects, I have helped scale many communities in other verticals such as DePIN and AI. For one client, I helped grow their community to over 400,000 Twitter followers, 500 smart followers and 200,000 Discord members. This was through a variety of methods such as airdrop strategies, questing, and partnerships with top-tier communities.",

    "suitability": "I am genuinely excited about the mission to accelerate verifiable computation on Solana. My career has been focused on leading teams to architect and deliver global, high-performance, and secure infrastructure platforms at the cutting edge of technology—experience that translates directly to this role's demands.\r\nPlease find my responses to your questions below.\r\nI> Your Personal Information\r\n1. Your full name and year of birth?\r\n○ Dr. William J. Wood (Bill Wood), Year of Birth: 1965\r\n2. What is your salary expectation (gross)?\r\n○ I am targeting the competitive range indicated in the job description, $240,000 to $275,000 USD base salary, regular performance bonuses, as well as significant equity that reflects the executive level and the potential of the Bonsol platform and its institutional backing by Anagram.\r\n3. The time that you can onboard?\r\n○ I am immediately available to onboard.\r\nII> Suitability for this Position\r\nIn these answers, I will highlight how my executive experience in leading infrastructure innovation directly supports the key strategic objective of this role: transitioning Bonsol from an R&D project into a scalable, production-ready protocol ready to handle increasing proof request volumes.\r\n1. How many years of Rust experience?\r\n○ While my foundational experience is in C/C++/Fortran/Assembler and leading large teams utilizing multiple enterprise-level languages, I have not yet personally written production code in Rust, but teams I managed have been for more than five years. My focus has been on the architectural, strategic, and security oversight of high-performance, low-level systems. Given my background (BS in Computer Science, Doctor of Information Technology, 20+ years developing real-time embedded systems), I am confident in quickly mastering Rust and leading a team specialized in it, focusing on architectural best practices, performance, and security review, which is the primary duty of the CTO.\r\n2. How many years building/maintaining high-scale production systems or Solana infrastructure tools?\r\n○ I have 25+ years of experience building and maintaining high-scale, global production systems, including 15 years as a CTO/Chief Architect for firms like AWS, Microsoft, Accenture, IBM, and Mangata Networks.\r\n○ Directly Relevant Experience: As CTO of Mangata Networks, I spearheaded the design and realization of a global edge-to-satellite-to-cloud network. This required building a decentralized, intelligent edge compute platform designed for massive scalability and performance. This is an architectural parallel to Bonsol's strategic goal of optimizing infrastructure to handle increasing proof request volumes and operationalizing a decentralized Prover Network. My mandate aligns perfectly with managing this critical scaling phase.\r\n3. Do you have solid experience writing Solana programs (Anchor, Pinocchio)?\r\n○ My experience is centered on Cloud and Enterprise Architecture, specializing in creating the foundational systems upon which application developers (Solana programs) build. I do not have direct experience writing programs using Anchor or Pinocchio but teams I managed were targeting these platforms as an extension of the global Mangata Networks terrestrial platform.\r\n○ Transferrable Leadership & Background: My work includes leading and auditing teams that design mission-critical, high-security systems (e.g., as Chief Cloud Auditor at Accenture, lead architect of the US Army’s LandWarNet global ISR network, and CTO of US Naval Intelligence Command Special Communications Center). Crucially, during my time as a Global Associate Partner at IBM, my role included extensive blockchain IP thought leadership and theory development. This foundation ensures I understand the core principles of decentralized architectures required for Solana programs, enabling me to effectively set standards and govern the technical output of the engineering team.\r\n4. How many years with zkVMs and writing zk programs (e.g., Risc0, Succinct, Groth16)?\r\n○ I do not have direct hands-on experience with zkVMs but teams I managed were targeting these platforms as an extension of the global Mangata Networks terrestrial platform which needed to span Web2/Web3 constructs to enable our global enterprise stakeholders.\r\n○ Strategic Alignment: My Doctorate research focused on Enterprise Cloud Innovation Adoption and Diffusion, and my experience includes spearheading AI/ML adoption into global platforms. I recently published a series of executive-level, enterprise AI adoption articles on LinkedIn focused on global AI/ML adoption to include an entire, end-to-end, product management and Go-to-Market strategy.

My career has consistently focused on first-principles thinking, especially in high-stakes environments like payments and identity infrastructure. I’m drawn to ZK and blockchain infrastructure because of its potential to shift paradigms particularly around verifiability, decentralization, and privacy-preserving computation. I’ve proactively explored zkLogin, RISC Zero, decentralized identity frameworks, and contributed to modular primitives that support multi-party trust and on-chain proof models. My motivation is to bridge theory with practical application and help bring scalable, privacy-preserving tech to production.",

    "suitability": "1. Yes. I have 10+ years of JavaScript/TypeScript experience, 9 years with React, and 8 years with React Native\r\n\r\n. I’ve built pixel-perfect mobile and web applications across healthcare, fintech, IoT security, and enterprise. At Achieve, I led a 15-engineer team delivering a neobank app using React Native + TypeScript with advanced onboarding (biometrics, MFA, dynamic forms). At Gemini Trust, I built high-performance trading screens with real-time charts, order books, and WebSocket-driven portfolio updates. My background also includes React on the web side (Axios Media, Bottomline Technologies), using Next.js, GraphQL, Apollo, Redux, and Context to deliver scalable apps.\r\n\r\n2. Yes. While not all projects publicly disclose DAU figures, several of my roles have been with consumer-facing startups and high-scale enterprises. For example:\r\n\r\nUST Global (Anthem/ShareCare) – healthcare apps serving millions of members with claims, authorizations, and digital ID features.\r\n\r\nGemini Trust – consumer crypto trading app handling real-time high-frequency market data for a global user base.\r\n\r\nBrightcove – enterprise streaming app supporting live corporate events with large concurrent audiences.\r\nHypothetically, if a startup like Habla AI (where I built data visualization apps) had reached market scale, my work there was structured to handle rapid growth.\r\n\r\n3. Absolutely. Throughout my career I’ve thrived in environments where I’ve had end-to-end responsibility. At LVT, I am currently implementing real-time IoT features — live video streaming, device management, and WebSocket integrations — with substantial autonomy. At Achieve, beyond engineering, I influenced technical decision-making, vendor integrations, and cloud architecture strategy. I also built independent projects (NeonDevTech) where I owned design, architecture, and delivery of full-stack React Native apps. I’m comfortable innovating, making trade-offs, and ensuring performance and scalability.\r\n\r\n4. Yes. At Brillio (Centene project), I worked within a modular NPM package architecture to build reusable feature modules (Claims, Coverage, Authorizations, Assessments). I implemented a MUI-based component library to ensure design consistency across multiple state-specific Medicaid apps. At Axios, I drove unit test coverage from 40% to 90% and built React component patterns to align with a Next.js/GraphQL design system. Across roles, I’ve created cross-platform component libraries that scale across iOS, Android, and web, supporting accessibility, localization, and brand consistency.\r\n5. Yes. While direct DAU metrics are proprietary, I have scaled apps with very large active user bases:\r\n\r\nGemini – optimized React Native rendering for high-frequency market data (charts/order books) to update sub-second via WebSockets.\r\n\r\nAnthem/ShareCare apps – healthcare platforms serving millions of members where I implemented performant claims and authorization screens.\r\n\r\nAxios – optimized server-side rendered React apps (Next.js) for SEO and fast rendering of large dynamic content feeds.\r\nThese roles demanded careful profiling, caching, memoization, and API optimization to maintain sub-second rendering under heavy load.\r\n6. Yes, I’ve done all of these:\r\n\r\nProfiling & Optimization – At Gemini, I optimized state updates and WebSocket handling for rapid crypto price updates. At Centene, I tuned Redux Toolkit + Saga workflows for healthcare data feeds.\r\n\r\nCross-platform libraries/design systems – Built MUI-based and modular NPM component libraries at Centene; reusable cross-platform components at Brightcove and Achieve.\r\n\r\nReleases/CI/CD – I’ve owned App Store/Play Store releases across multiple projects, supporting biweekly release cadences (Centene) and implementing CI/CD pipelines with tools like Bitrise, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions\r\nexpect:$250K\r\nStart Immediately ",

NodeJS is my backend of choice but am also fluent in Python and Golang because of projects at IBM.\r\n\r\nI am absolutely strong in Typescript and React Native since I have been using it in its inception back in 2014. I have built financial apps in both IBM and Collegeboard in React Native as a replacement for iOS and Android apps as an MVP before doing a trial release to a limited audience to review User Experience and slowly pivot towards React Native while easing off the native apps. \r\n\r\nI am skilled in both mobile and cross-platform development as well as a11y and responsiveness in both landscapes with React Native .\r\n\r\nAt IBM and Collegeboard, I always delivered projects with security as top priority even when it was not explicitly stated. I have implemented JWT, OIDC, OAuth, SSO, AWS Secrets Manager across the webdev spectrum as well as in mobile. \r\n\r\nAt Collegeboard, I participated in releasing prod-ready React Native projects for a limited audience using Launchdarkly for flagged releases. At IBM, I participated in self-hosted releases of React Native projects supported by IBM Cloud and their offering. Both apps were within the space of finance. ",

    "suitability": "1. Yes, I have over 5 years of full-time experience leading and scaling Web3 communities across Best Wallet, Vexor, and Vent finance.\r\n\r\n2. I am highly active in the crypto ecosystem and deeply embedded in its culture. Over the past several years, I have managed and grown large Web3 communities, hosted more than 100 AMAs and community calls, collaborated with top projects and partners, and led ambassador programs across Discord, Telegram, Twitter, and major Web3 engagement platforms like Galxe, Zealy, QuestN, and TaskOn. I stay consistently involved in emerging narratives, protocol updates, user sentiment, and ecosystem trends, ensuring that communities remain informed, engaged, and aligned with the fast-moving world of crypto, DeFi, and Web3.\r\n\r\n3. At Best Wallet, I scaled Discord and Telegram from 10,000 to over 100,000 members within four months, implementing a structured engagement strategy that boosted weekly active users by 50% and message activity by 70%. I also built and led an ambassador program of more than 90 ambassadors, including moderators, translators, and regional leaders, ensuring smooth communication, task coordination, and consistent community messaging. In addition, I regularly hosted and moderated AMAs, managed moderation systems, and maintained a secure environment through automated scam-prevention processes—requiring clear, transparent, and effective communication across the entire community.\r\n\r\nAt Vexor, I built a cross-platform community from 0 to 30,000+ members in just six months, organizing more than 20 AMAs, Q&A sessions, and product-focused events. This role demanded strong public-speaking abilities, event facilitation, and the skill to communicate complex product concepts in a user-friendly way. I also coordinated closely with ambassadors and strategic partners, demonstrating strong cross-team collaboration and communication.\r\n\r\nAt Vent Finance, I managed a community that grew to more than 200,000 members and hosted over 100 AMA sessions. I improved engagement by up to 60% through refined communication and platform strategies across Twitter, Discord, and Telegram. Leading a team of 70+ ambassadors required clear instruction, consistent messaging, ongoing feedback, and the ability to communicate effectively at scale.\r\n\r\n4. Some of the platforms and tools i have been using\r\n\r\n- Discord & Telegram — advanced management, automation, analytics , bots integrations and more\r\n- Twitter/X, Medium, Link3\r\n- Quest/Gamification Platforms: Galxe, Zealy, QuestN, TaskOn, Intract, RabbitHole and more\r\n- AMA & streaming tools: StreamYard, Loom\r\n- Content & Ops Tools: Blaze, TG Suite, Notion, Eclincher,\r\n Typeform, Zapier and more\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Yes, I maintain an active presence across major social platforms, including Twitter/X, where I regularly engage with Web3 communities, share project updates, and participate in ecosystem discussions. Throughout my roles at Best Wallet, Vexor, and Vent Finance, I have managed and grown social audiences, coordinated content strategies, and driven engagement across Twitter/X and other channels. Additionally, I have extensive experience working in early-stage Web3 startups, where I helped build communities from the ground up—scaling user bases from zero to tens of thousands, creating ambassador programs, supporting go-to-market execution, and adapting quickly to fast-moving, high-growth environments.\r\n\r\n6. I am Romanian, currently living in the UK, and I have full rights to work in the UK.\r\n7. nego",

Very involved, I am mining since 2011, active in defi since 2016, and I am a reasonably known figure \r\n\r\n3. 1 Exemple: \r\n a good example would be last year when we migrated the token contract. This required very clear and precise communication across the community to ensure that the instructions were easy to follow and execute for the migration. \r\n\r\nAt the same time I had to be very proactive to prevent scammers from taking advantage of the situation by educating our community and quickly dealing with fud and other issues. \r\n\r\nTo do this I lead regular community VCs to guide our members, as well as answer questions and tackle any uncertainty. \r\n\r\nWe had a 6 month token migration so this was a long term project, but we achieved over 97% successful migration of over 24,000 holders. \r\n4.

    "suitability": "4+ years of experience as a community leader in crypto/Web3\r\nThe candidate has... experience leading communities in related fields, but not explicitly in crypto/Web3. Her experience includes amplifying brand presence and strengthening engagement across a 50,000+ member community at New Mexico United (July 2021-July 2022). She also led international campaigns to expand public awareness and elevate program credibility at the UN (Jan 2024-present). Her most relevant experience is her 16+ years of shaping narrative ecosystems across global institutions and regulated industries, which indicates a strong background in managing complex communication and community dynamics, but a direct link to a 4+ year Web3 community leadership role is missing.\r\nDeeply embedded in crypto culture; fluent in narratives & evolving ecosystem\r\nThe candidate has... exceptional skill in shaping narrative ecosystems across global institutions and regulated industries. She has experience translating complex regulations (like SEC/FINRA, NIST, CISA ZT) into accessible buyer narratives. She is an expert in Editorial Strategy & Thought Leadership , Brand Narrative Development & Positioning , and has certification in Generative AI (Google) and Human-Centered AI (Northwestern University). While she doesn't mention \"crypto culture,\" her ability to rapidly grasp, define categories, and align brand strategy with regulatory narratives demonstrates the intellectual capacity to become fluent in the crypto ecosystem quickly.\r\nExcellent communicator with strong interpersonal skills & high emotional intelligence\r\nThe candidate has... outstanding communication skills, evidenced by her roles as an official spokesperson and advisor for UN executive visibility , her leadership of cross-functional teams , and her history of advising C-suite leaders on strategic communications and reputation positioning. Her certifications in Positive Psychology (UNC Chapel Hill) and Well-Being Science (Yale University) suggest a formal grounding in the principles that underpin high emotional intelligence and effective interpersonal dynamics. She has been in strategic communications for 16+ years.\r\nSkilled in community platforms, social tools & data-driven engagement strategies\r\nThe candidate has... strong skills in SEO, Audience Growth & Content Ecosystems. She has extensive experience with digital activations and increasing audience engagement using SEO-driven editorial calendars and story architecture. For example, she boosted public engagement by 30% at the UN in 2025 and increased audience engagement by 40% in 2023 at PBS X Next Avenue. Her certification in Social Media Marketing (Meta Institute) further supports her familiarity with social and digital engagement tools.\r\nActive personal Twitter presence & startup early-stage experience \r\nThe candidate has... experience leading global communications and brand strategy at LeapXpert (Aug 2025 - present) , a company she is currently working to cement as a market leader. While the CV does not explicitly state an active personal Twitter presence or \"early-stage\" startup experience, her current role requires scaling marketing and PR programs and architecting integrated content strategy, which demands a high degree of agility and execution typical of a high-growth environment. Her LinkedIn URL is provided in the contact information.\r\n\r\nHigh Recommendation\r\nI highly recommend Ximena Araya-Fischel for a senior communications or content role. While she does not have a direct 4+ year background in crypto/Web3 community leadership, her profile demonstrates an extraordinary track record as a Strategic Communications Architect and Communications Executive in highly regulated, complex, and global environments (UN, Forbes, LeapXpert).\r\nHer ability to immediately step in as Editor-in-Chief, architect global content strategy, and translate complex regulatory frameworks (SEC/FINRA) into accessible narratives is a direct and highly valuable transferrable skill for navigating the legal and narrative complexity of the crypto space. She is a proven leader in driving significant audience growth (30-40% engagement boosts) using data-driven methods (SEO) and holds advanced certifications relevant to the future of the industry (Generative AI, Human-Centered AI).\r\nHer exceptional ability to shape narrative, drive executive thought leadership, and manage reputation across global platforms makes her an outstanding candidate who can quickly master the specifics of the crypto ecosystem and strategically position any Web3 organization for market leadership\r\nCandidate’s Location\r\nNew York City, US\r\nCandidate’s Salary Expectations (USD)\r\nFrom $160,0000\r\nAvailability\r\nAvailable to start in 4 weeks.\r\n",

    "suitability": "1. How I meet the hiring criteria\r\nI meet the hiring criteria through my experience in high-performance system design,\r\nblockchain infrastructure, and protocol-focused engineering. I have over ten years of\r\nexperience delivering production systems and taking them from early research and design all\r\nthe way to secure, scalable implementations.\r\nMy work has consistently focused on performance optimization, latency reduction,\r\nreliability, and security, especially in distributed and blockchain-based systems. I’m\r\ncomfortable translating protocol or research concepts into practical, production-ready\r\narchitectures. In addition to hands-on development, I’ve taken on end-to-end ownership and\r\ntechnical leadership, including driving architectural decisions, reviewing critical code paths,\r\nand mentoring engineers to ensure long-term scalability and maintainability.\r\n2. My experience with trading, exchange, or financial infrastructure\r\nI have strong hands-on experience building trading and financial infrastructure, particularly in\r\ncrypto and DeFi. This includes working on decentralized exchanges, implementing core\r\ncomponents such as swap engines, liquidity mechanisms, and supporting backend services.\r\nIn most of these roles, I was responsible for architecture, core implementation, performance\r\ntuning, and operational hardening, with a strong emphasis on low-latency execution and fault\r\ntolerance.\r\n3. My experience with Python, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS\r\nLow-latency and high-throughput systems\r\n● Node.js: I’ve used Node.js extensively to build backend services for trading platforms,\r\nhandling real-time data ingestion, execution flows, and API reliability. My focus has been\r\non concurrency, performance tuning, and stable production behavior.\r\n● AWS: I have strong experience designing and operating cloud-based infrastructure,\r\nincluding deployment automation, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and security best\r\npractices, while scaling systems reliably.\r\n● MongoDB: I’ve worked with MongoDB in distributed backend and microservices\r\narchitectures, applying appropriate NoSQL data modeling patterns to support high-write\r\nworkloads and fast reads.● Python: I mainly use Python for data processing, research, prototyping, and\r\nAI-related tasks, rather than latency-critical execution paths.\r\nOverall, I have extensive experience building low-latency, high-throughput systems,\r\nparticularly in trading and crypto environments, with a strong focus on distributed system\r\nperformance, efficient data flows, and protocol-level optimization.\r\nExpected Salary: 8,500 usd/month\r\nOnboarding date: 4 weeks",
